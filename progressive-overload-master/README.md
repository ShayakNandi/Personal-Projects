# Progressive Overload

My project is about Progressive Overload. It is an app that is intended for an audience that goes to the gym regularly and lifts weight. Progressive Overload is an important aspect when it comes to lifting weights and people usually do not have a good way to track it - It is disorganized that is why I wish to make an app, for it to be feasibly tracked. There will be selection of exercises in the app which the users themselves add. Then, users will enter the "reps", "sets" and "weight" after the workout for the exercise that was selected. There is a view page in the app where the progress of each workout is written and shown in a graphical format. Based off this, the user can track their progressive overload. It is a very simple app and the wireframes are attached.
